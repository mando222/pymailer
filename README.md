# pymailer

This is a simple python script that will pull a message out of a msg.txt file in the project dir and send it using gmail's mail server. 

You must have your gmail accounts app password in a password.txt file in the same dir as the script. 

This script will use a CSV file in the format of "name,email" to get target email accounts.

Additionally you must fill in the sending address, subject, and sender name fields in the script for the header to format correctly.
